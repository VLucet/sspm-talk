### How much fish are there?

<!--# Modelling populations -->

Early population models assumed that the conditions governing parameters affecting rate of change (growth rate, carrying capacity) stay constant

### Non-stationarity

Models increasingly acknowledge the **non-stationary** nature of wild populations, and work to incorporate environmental fluctuations into dynamic models.

Population models designed to answer applied resource management questions, such as **fisheries stock models**, increasingly address how the dynamics of stocks vary across space and time.

[![*Examples of non-stationarity*](images/non-stat.png){fig-align="left"}](https://hess.copernicus.org/articles/25/3897/2021/)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Implications for fisheries management

Fisheries managers are:

1. Becoming increasingly interested in how variation in ecosystem factors (predator abundance, abiotic variables) impact the spatiotemporal variability of population parameters such as **productivity**. 
2. Pushing for more **ecosystem-based management** methods in fisheries management

Treating spatially structured stocks as single unstructured stocks can lead to biased estimates *YET* stock models that explicitly incorporate spatio-temporal dynamics are still rare in fisheries science

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Surplus Production Models

Surplus production models (SPMs) are one of the classic models used in fisheries, and are based on modelling changes in the total biomass of a stock in a given location over time (i.e. *surplus production*) as a function of current stock abundance and fishing pressure:

$$
B_t = B_{t-1} + P_{t-1} - C_{t-1}
$$
Where $B_t$ is the biomass, $P_t$ is productivity and $C_t$ is harvest (i.e. catch)

SPMs are useful in data-poor contexts, for example in the absence of population structure data
  
------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Limitations of SPMs

SPMS assumptions:

1. Spatially **constant** productivity 
2. Stock productivity is affected **only** by stock abundance and fishing. 
3. Classically, single unstructured stocks with purely **logistic** dynamics

These assumptions ignore the effect of global changes that are affecting fisheries, such as climate change, that affect the growth rates of stocks independently of fishing pressure. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Northern Shrimp

The Northern Shrimp (*Pandalus borealis*) in the Newfoundland and Labrador Shelves, which has undergone several periods of large-scale biomass change in the last two decades, despite a relatively constant harvest regime.

These stocks currently lack a population model to understand the drivers of this change, and to predict how fishing pressure and changing environmental conditions may affect future abundance in the region. 

<!-- In the context of climate change and shifting ranges, fisheries productivity is likely to be a moving target and managers need better methods that account for varying productivity. -->

### Modelling approaches

-   **process-based:** often rely on differential equations and are based on replicating the underlying processes (predation, recruitment, dispersal) driving population dynamics

-   **statistical:** fit a regression model to time series of population abundances, abundance indices, or productivities, with some assumed error distribution for variation around predictions. 

Statistical models allow for estimation of parameter uncertainty and ranges of model predictions, and for flexibly incorporating potential ecosystem drivers into models 

Statistical models also allow for straight-forward estimation of spatial variation in population parameters such as maximum productivity or density dependence from data, in the absence of theory predicting how these parameters should vary. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Spatial SPMs

we use a statistical approach to fitting SPMs using Generalized Additive Models (GAMS), estimated using the `mgcv` R package as the backend. 

We apply this approach to the population of Northern Shrimp of the Newfoundland and Labrador Shelves, leveraging the smoothing properties of GAMs to account for varying productivity across time and space. 

The resulting model is a spatial SPM (SSPM), implemented via a R package `sspm`.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### The need for `sspm`

1.  Fisheries productivity models rarely integrate important spatially-structured ecosystem drivers
2.  Northern Shrimp populations the Newfoundland and Labrador Shelves currently lacks a model
3.  Current SPM models are rarely spatially explicit and usually cannot account for relevant ecosystem drivers
4.  Fisheries managers lack user-friendly, flexible tools to implement and apply spatial SPMs

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### The `sspm` workflow

Ingestion of variables as well as spatial boundaries and discretization into patches.

1.  Smoothing data using spatio-temporal GAMs smoothers.
2.  Computation of productivity values taking into account harvest information.
3.  Fitting of SSPMs to smoothed data with GAMs.
4.  Visualization of results, including confidence and prediction intervals.
5.  One step ahead prediction of biomass.

### Generalizing the SSPM approach

While the initial application of this model was modelling Newfoundland and Labrador Northern Shrimp stocks, the R package `sspm` is designed to make spatially-explicit surplus production models (SSPM) simpler to estimate and apply to any spatially structured stock. 

The package uses GAMs to estimate spatiotemporally varying biomass, and to estimate SSPMs based on changes in fitted biomass, observed catch, and spatially structured environmental predictors. 

It includes a range of features to manage biomass and harvest data. Those features are organized in a stepwise workflow, whose implementation is described in more detail in \autoref{fig:workflow}.
