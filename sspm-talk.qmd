<!--# Modelling populations -->

Early population models such assumed that the conditions governing parameters affecting rate of change (growth rate, carrying capacity) stay constant

![](images/log_with_K.png){fig-align="center"}

## Surplus Production Models

-   SPMs are simple, old pop models, in need of updating to account for the non-stationarity of the mechanisms that maintain stocks

## Modelling approaches

-   **process-based:** often rely on differential equations and are based on replicating the underlying processes (predation, recruitment, dispersal) behind population dynamics

-   **statistical:** rely on fitting a model to data using distributional assumptions, and present the advantage of naturally measuring uncertainty around predictions

## Statement of need

1.  Fisheries productivity models, rarely integrate important spatially-structured ecosystem drivers
2.  Northern Shrimp populations the Newfoundland and Labrador Shelves currently lacks a model
3.  Current SPM models are rarely spatially explicit and usually cannot account for relevant ecosystem drivers
4.  Fisheries managers lack user-friendly, flexible tools to implement and apply spatial SPMs

## The sspm workflow

1.  Ingestion of variables as well as spatial boundaries and discretization into patches.
2.  Smoothing data using spatio-temporal GAMs smoothers.
3.  Computation of productivity values taking into account harvest information.
4.  Fitting of SSPMs to smoothed data with GAMs.
5.  Visualization of results, including confidence and prediction intervals.
6.  One step ahead prediction of biomass.

## The need for `sspm`

1\. Population models, in particular fisheries productivity models, rarely integrate important spatially-structured ecosystem drivers

2\. The Northern Shrimp stock in the Newfoundland and Labrador Shelves currently lacks a population model

3\. Current SPM models are rarely spatially explicit and usually cannot account for relevant ecosystem drivers

4\. Fisheries managers lack user-friendly, flexible tools to implement and apply SSPMs
